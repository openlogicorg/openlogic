# OpenLogic

**Freedom in Logic. Freedom in Computing.**

OpenLogic is a global initiative and community movement dedicated to the belief that every computer user is the rightful owner of not just the physical device, but also the logical behavior of the system they run.

We advocate for **logical freedom** — the right to run, understand, modify, and share any logical system or behavior on your hardware without artificial restrictions imposed by vendors or proprietary ecosystems.

## 🔍 Vision

To make logical behavior in computing open, understandable, and fully under the control of the user.

## 🌱 Mission

- Promote the concept of **logical freedom**.
- Encourage the creation and use of **transparent**, **open**, and **user-definable** computing systems.
- Educate and empower users to understand and define the logic their systems follow.
- Build tools, examples, and documentation that make this vision accessible.

## 📜 OpenLogic Principles

1. **Logic Belongs to the User**
2. **Freedom to Understand**
3. **Freedom to Modify and Replace**
4. **Freedom from Proprietary Lock-in**
5. **Freedom to Share and Build Together**

## 🧩 Example Projects

- Minimal Understandable OS
- Logic-as-Code
- Educational Docs
